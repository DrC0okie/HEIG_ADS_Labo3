Task 1: Exercises on redirection
Compile the following C++ program, called out.cpp , into an executable. The program
writes a series of O characters on the stdout stream and a series of E characters
on the stderr stream:
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;
int main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
cout << "O";
cerr << "E";
}
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
Run the executable with ./out
1. Run the following commands and tell where stdout and stderr are redirected to.
a. ./out > file b. ./out 2> file c. ./out > file 2>&1 d. ./out 2>&1 > file
e. ./out &> file
2. What do the following commands do?
a. cat /usr/share/doc/cron/README | grep -i edit
b. ./out 2>&1 | grep –i eeeee
c. ./out 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep –i eeeee
3. Write commands to perform the following tasks:
a. Produce a recursive listing, using ls , of files and directories in your
home directory, including hidden files, in the file /tmp/homefileslist .
b. Produce a (non-recursive) listing of all files in your home directory whose
names end in .txt , .md or .pdf , in the file /tmp/homedocumentslist . The
command must not display an error message if there are no corresponding files.
